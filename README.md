# amdgpu-fancontrol-python3.7
This is a WIP fancontrol script for controlling gpu fanspeeds
many features are missing due to it's early status. 
Planned features are:
  * Automatic card detection
    - Detection of max and min speeds
  * Improved fancontrol (Fanspeed can get stuck on a certain speed because the temperature doesn't drop,
                          despite lower speeds being possible without temperature increasing)
  * Configuration files
  * Multi-GPU support
